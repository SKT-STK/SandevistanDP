you can activate sandevistan by crouching and right-clicking with either a sword, an axe, or a trident  
to deactivate it do the same or just w8 till it runs out  
you can also enchant a bow or a trident with sandevistan to make them not freeze while its activated, otherwise arrows shot or tridents thrown will just freeze in time normally  
mobs wont receive damage while in sandevistan, but they will keep track of damage dealt to them and receive it once the effect ends  
tnts and creepers wont explode during sandevistan, but same as for mobs, they will keep track of time passed and behave accordingly once the effects ends
